<h2 class="uncounted">Abstract</h2>
<p>In the year 2020 there will be chips with 1000 or more cores. Due to
architectural restrictions such multiprocessor systems on a chip (MPSoC)
will increasingly look similar to current cluster architectures. In
other words, future embedded applications will look like current cluster
applications used in scientific/high-performance computing. Invasive
Computing is a new paradigm, which encourages resource-aware
programming. The X10 language is an appropriate tool in this context,
as it provides a modern programming language with a partitioned global
address space (PGAS) approach.  However, in embedded systems the compiler
must often adapt very closely the target architecture to support its
special features. To avoid the problems with the current Java and C++
backends, we develop an additional one, which is based on libFirm and
outputs assembler.</p>

<h2 class="counting">Introduction</h2>
<p>Moore’s Law of exponentially increasing transistor counts per chip
space appears to hold for the next years. However, due to technical
issues, chip producers are unable to translate “more transistors”
into “faster processors” for the last decade. Instead, multicore
architectures were introduced. Extrapolating those trends, we can expect
reach a thousand cores by 2020. Unfortunately, our current architecture
will have to change to scale accordingly. For example, bus snooping cache
coherence protocols do not scale. The answer could be to sacrifice cache
coherence, which brings up additional problems for programmers. Another
aspect is energy consumption, which could be decreased by lowering the
voltage. However, this increases the chance of computation failures.</p>

<h3 class="counting">Invasive Computing</h3>

<p>The Invasive Computing [7] paradigm is an answer to these challenges. It suggests a resource-aware programming model, where
the system adapts to changing resource needs and availabilities. The core concepts are invasion, infection and retreat, which
basically mean resource acquisition, use and release. The processes compete for the available resources, which results into self-organizing behavior.</p>

<p>Such a resource-aware programming style also enables the processes to use uncommon hardware features, like reconfigurable
processors [5]. This open up a lot of possibilities, which should also
reflect on higher levels, such as the operating system, the compiler,
the programming language, and the application.</p>

<h3 class="counting">libFirm</h3>

<p>The libFirm infrastructure provides a generic compiler backend
for multiple architectures and a suite of optimizations, which are
performed on the Firm intermediate representation.</p>

<p>The libFirm library was mostly used for research on code generation, most prominently for SSA-based register allocation [1–4].
However, it also contains most common optimization techniques
and is comparable to production compilers.</p>

<p>The Firm intermediate representation is always in SSA form and
needs never be deconstructed during code generation. It is graph-based and consists of operations and dependency edges, which
model data-, control flow-, instruction schedule-, and more dependencies.</p>

<h3 class="counting">X10</h3>

<p>The X10 programming language \cite{x10report220}
already provides various features,
which make it suitable for programming \enquote{invasive architectures},
since it was developed for todays high-performance computing.
For example, the partitioned global address space (PGAS),
which models a cluster network adapts quite naturally
to a cache-incoherent multi-core architecture.
The employable X10 concept is a \intro{place}.
Threads, which are executed in the same place, have shared memory,
whereas threads in different places must communicate
with other means.</p>

<p>Compared to the C language,
X10 lacks the \enquote{close to the metal} features.
For example, the memory is always managed by a garbage collector
and there is no distinction between different kinds of memory.
However, future architectures might need to differ between
off-core memory (large, slow, cache incoherent) and
on-core memory (small, fast, cache coherent),
instead of relying on caching policies.</p>

<p>Currently, the X10 compiler can produce Java and C++ code,
which adds another layer between programmer and processor.
For example,
the type information of an X10 program
does not completely fit into the Java/C++ representation.
Due to this indirection some optimization possibilities are missed
and some unnecessary overhead is introduced,
e.g. to maintain runtime type information.</p>

<p>We present our work on a native assembler backend for the X10 compiler,
which employs libFirm for optimization and code generation.
Although it does not support the full language yet,
we identified issues and opportunities.</p>

<p>In \autoref{sec:related} we discuss other backends
and code generation approaches.
Then \autoref{sec:challenges} presents the issues with the current system
and \autoref{sec:status} shows, what is left to do.
Finally, we close in \autoref{sec:conclusion}.</p>
